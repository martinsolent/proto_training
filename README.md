## Sourcing Images and Copyright

In design work you have three choices when it comes to using photographic images: 

1. Sourcing from a picture library (free or paid) 
2. Commissioning a photographer 
3. Take the picture yourself.  



Traditionally designers had used either used [commission photographs](http://www.londonfreelance.org/feesguide/index.php?section=Photography) or ["royalty free"](https://stockphotolicense.com/faq/) images use low resolution water marked images to create design composition or [“comps”](https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Can-I-get-comp-Images-or-Clips) to shown clients. Once the design is finalised they buy the rights to use, but not fully own, the full quality image.

There are also [Creative Commons ](https://creativecommons.org/)or [Public Domain](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/) images that can be used free or with some restrictions such as have a link base to the author.
